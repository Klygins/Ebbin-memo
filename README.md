# Ebbinghaus Memo app
It is a small and easy-to-use utility based on a theory of forgetting curves. 

## How to 
1. Write what you want to remember, hit 'Create', and minimize the app. 
2. It will notify you when you need to recall this knowledge. 
3. During 7 repetitions (the last one is after 4 months) you will remember what was saved at nearly 80% of the first capacity
